  Too many connections

Please:
1 Check that mysql is running on server prism-db.cixpikrggo1y.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com
2 Check that mysql is running on port 3306 (note: 3306 is the default, but this can be changed)
3 Check the prism_admin has rights to connect to prism-db.cixpikrggo1y.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com from your address (mysql rights define what clients can connect to the server and from which machines) 
4 Make sure you are both providing a password if needed and using the correct password for prism-db.cixpikrggo1y.us-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com connecting from the host address you're connecting from
